## Inventory Management System (IMS)

## Introduction

-   An inventory management system is the combination of technology (hardware and software) and processes
procedures that oversee the monitoring and maintenance of stocked products, whether those products are company assets, raw materials and supplies.
-   A system for identifying every inventory item and its associated information, such as barcode labels or asset tags.
-   Inventory management software, which provides a central database and point of reference for all inventory, coupled with the ability to analyze data, generate reports, forecast future demand, and more.

## Benefits of Inventory Management Systems
Without an inventory management system, the goods and products that flow through an organization will inevitably be in disarray. An inventory management system enables a company to maintain a centralized record of every asset and item in the control of the organization, providing a single source of truth for the location of every item, vendor and supplier information, specifications, and the total number of a particular item currently in stock.

Overall, a comprehensive inventory management system offers countless benefits to companies including:
-   Improved cash flow
-   Better reporting and forecasting capabilities
-   Reduction in storage costs (overhead)
-   Reduced labor costs
-   Reduction in dead stock
-   Better organization
-   Enhanced transparency
-   Improved supplier, vendor, and partner relationships

##  Implementation Block Diagram
Here we are implementing only for limited number of features, as follows:
Step1: Product is added at first
Step2: Now product can be deleted or add new product
Step3: Modify or delete product
Step4: We can search for product
Step5: Display all the available product
